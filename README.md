# All-About-Me
## Lily Weirich
My Name is Lily Weirich, and I am a junior here at The University of Missouri. I am majoring in Psychology with an emphasis in Human Resources and Hospitality Managament. I grew up in a small town in Southern Illinois called Alton, which is where most of my family lives. I currently stay in an apartment with my four close friends, and my fifth roommate, my Bunny, Beans!
